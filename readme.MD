# Heart Disease Classification Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a heart disease classification model using various machine learning algorithms. The objective is to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on multiple input features. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, using various models such as 
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. RandomForestClassifier (RFC)
3. LinearSVM
4. Linear Regression.

## Project Structure

The project directory includes the following key files and folders:

- **`data/`**: Contains raw datasets and preprocessing scripts.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training.
- **`src/`**: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- **`requirements.txt`** : This file contains the necessary libraries to be present in the environment to run the model.

#### **Accuracy achieved : 84.79%**
